 Data Collection: Lambda + S3 + CloudFront + EventBridge

Each month, Tennessee PD releases checkpoint info as PDFs. I set up an AWS Lambda function triggered by a monthly EventBridge cron job to grab these PDFs and toss them into an S3 bucket. The function also cleans up older PDFs, keeping the storage neat.

In my previous project ( https://www.rejectedvanityplates.com ) I got some feed back about directly hitting s3 buckets for relatively static data. So I set up a CF CDN in front of the bucket this time which the Lambda actually hits. The same is true of the site itself.

Hosting the Site: S3 + CloudFront + Route 53

The front end itself is a simple static website sitting in another S3 bucket, delivered via CloudFront CDN. For security, I implemented Origin Access Control, so only CloudFront can reach the bucket directly. Route 53 handles DNS.

WAF is set up to protect CloudFront from the usual suspects.

A Better Solution if I was Going to do this Again.

Honestly, parsing the PDFs into structured HTML with Lambda and directly updating the S3 bucket with static HTML monthly wouldâ€™ve been even more performant. But hey, I mainly did this to practice data scraping with AWS, and it only took an evening to slap it all together.
Framework Check

The PDFs are only a few MB in size, but the architecture should be able to handle much bigger datasets. From the Well-Architected Framework, I tried to achieve.

    Operational Excellence: Automation via Lambda and EventBridge.

    Security: Using OAC and WAF.

    Reliability: Cloudfront for high avail.

    Performance Efficiency: Caching strategy.

    Cost Optimization: Reduced direct S3 access.
